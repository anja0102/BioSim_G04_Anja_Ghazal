### Summary
This is a project that simulates population dynamics on an Island. 
The Island is built of different types of terrain, 
and hosts animals og type Herbivores and Carnivores.
The simulation will illustrate how the lifecycle of the Island forms the fauna and available fodder.
All animals can eat (either fodder or herbivores), breed, die and migrate to different 
parts of the Island restricted by given conditions and probabilites.
The yearly update of movements are shown in a visualisation window with density plots and 
distribution graphs.
